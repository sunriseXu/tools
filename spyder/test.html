<p>Similar to <code><a href="../../../../reference/android/app/job/JobScheduler.html#schedule(android.app.job.JobInfo)">schedule(JobInfo)</a></code>, but allows you to enqueue work for a new <em>or existing</em>
    job.  If a job with the same ID is already scheduled, it will be replaced with the
    new <code><a href="../../../../reference/android/app/job/JobInfo.html">JobInfo</a></code>, but any previously enqueued work will remain and be dispatched the
    next time it runs.  If a job with the same ID is already running, the new work will be
    enqueued for it.
   
    <p>The work you enqueue is later retrieved through
    <code><a href="../../../../reference/android/app/job/JobParameters.html#dequeueWork()">JobParameters.dequeueWork</a></code>.  Be sure to see there
    about how to process work; the act of enqueueing work changes how you should handle the
    overall lifecycle of an executing job.</p>
   
    <p>It is strongly encouraged that you use the same <code><a href="../../../../reference/android/app/job/JobInfo.html">JobInfo</a></code> for all work you
    enqueue.  This will allow the system to optimally schedule work along with any pending
    and/or currently running work.  If the JobInfo changes from the last time the job was
    enqueued, the system will need to update the associated JobInfo, which can cause a disruption
    in execution.  In particular, this can result in any currently running job that is processing
    previous work to be stopped and restarted with the new JobInfo.</p>
   
    <p>It is recommended that you avoid using
    <code><a href="../../../../reference/android/app/job/JobInfo.Builder.html#setExtras(android.os.PersistableBundle)">JobInfo.Builder.setExtras(PersistableBundle)</a></code> or
    <code><a href="../../../../reference/android/app/job/JobInfo.Builder.html#setTransientExtras(android.os.Bundle)">JobInfo.Builder.setTransientExtras(Bundle)</a></code> with a JobInfo you are using to
    enqueue work.  The system will try to compare these extras with the previous JobInfo,
    but there are situations where it may get this wrong and count the JobInfo as changing.
    (That said, you should be relatively safe with a simple set of consistent data in these
    fields.)  You should never use <code><a href="../../../../reference/android/app/job/JobInfo.Builder.html#setClipData(android.content.ClipData, int)">JobInfo.Builder.setClipData(ClipData, int)</a></code> with
    work you are enqueue, since currently this will always be treated as a different JobInfo,
    even if the ClipData contents are exactly the same.</p></p></p>
